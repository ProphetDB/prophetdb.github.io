[[!meta title="Get SD"]]

Released versions of SD are available on CPAN. SD is currently
undergoing rapid development however, so we recommend installing
directly from Git if you can. SD's public mirror is currently hosted on
GitHub.

Before you install SD, you'll need to install Prophet.

The following command will get you a copy of the source tree you can install:

>git clone git://github.com/bestpractical/sd.git

Once you've downloaded SD, you can install it:

>cd sd

>PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl Makefile.PL

>make test

>make install

In the hopefully unlikely event that SD doesn't pass its tests, please
tell the developers about it so we can improve things.
