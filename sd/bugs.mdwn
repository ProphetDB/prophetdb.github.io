It should come as no surprise that we use SD to track bugs in itself. If you
have an installed copy of SD, you can create a local clone of the current live
database by running the following command from a checkout of SD's git
repository:

> git sd clone --from http://fsck.com/~jesse/sd-bugs/

Or, if you don't have or want a local checkout of SD:

> SD\_REPO=~/sd-bugs sd clone --from http://fsck.com/~jesse/sd-bugs/

You can update your copy of the buglist by running:

> git sd pull --all

Submitting bug reports to SD's developers
=========================================

For now, submit bug reports on SD against ["App-SD" on CPAN's Request
Tracker](https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=App-SD).  You can
also send email to <bug-App-SD@rt.cpan.org>. We'll regularly sync
SD's bug replica with the RT queue.
