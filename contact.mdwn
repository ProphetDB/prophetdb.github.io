[[!meta title="Get in touch"]]

Despite Prophet being designed for "offline" replication, Prophet's (and
SD's) developers are nearly constantly online. You can usually find us
on IRC and can always contact us by email.

IRC
===

Prophet's developers hang out on #prophet on irc.oftc.net.

Electronic Mail
===========

If you're looking for something a little more asynchronous than IRC,
electronic mail is always a reasonable option. You can
[sign up for the Prophet mailing list or browse the list
archives](http://lists.bestpractical.com/mailman/listinfo/prophet) over
at Best Practical's mailing list server. There's also an [SD
list](http://lists.bestpractical.com/mailman/listinfo/sd) for
SD-specific discussion.
