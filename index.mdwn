Prophet
======

Prophet is a new kind of database designed for the post Web-2.0 world.
It's made to let you collaborate with your friends and coworkers without
needing any kind of special server or internet provider.

Prophet's buzzword-laden pitch reads something like this:

> A grounded, semirelational, peer to peer replicated, disconnected,
> versioned, property database with self-healing conflict resolution.

The best place to start learning about Prophet is
[a few recent slides decks and videos](/talks/).

[[SD]] (Simple Defects)
===============

Prophet is flexible enough to be used for all sorts of applications, but
we've started with something near and dear to the hearts of most
software developers: bug tracking.

SD is a peer to peer bug tracking system which we've built to share with
just about anything. Contributors have helped us write adaptors for RT,
Hiveminder, Trac, GitHub, Google Code, and Redmine. You can extend SD to
sync to other bug tracking tools by writing a small bit of code. If you
can help make SD work better with your bug tracker,
[drop us a line](/contact/).

Installation
================

Follow the instructions on the [[installation]] page to install Prophet
and SD.
