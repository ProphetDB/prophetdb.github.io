[[!meta title="Get Prophet"]]

Released versions of Prophet are available on CPAN and in
[Debian](http://packages.debian.org/sid/libprophet-perl) and
[Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/oneiric/libprophet-perl). If you're
running one of these operating systems, you can install the latest
prophet release like this:

>apt-get install libprophet-perl

Prophet is currently undergoing rapid development however, so we
recommend installing directly from Git if you can.

The following command will get you a copy of the source tree you can install:

>git clone git://gitorious.org/prophet/prophet.git

Once you've downloaded Prophet, you can install it:

>cd prophet

>PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl Makefile.PL

>make test

>make install

In the hopefully unlikely event that Prophet doesn't pass its tests,
please [tell the developers](/contact/) about it so we can improve things.
