[[!meta title="Get Prophet"]]

Prophet is currently undergoing a major refactoring, so we recommend installing
the released packages if you just want to try using it.

# Releases

## CPAN

https://metacpan.org/module/Prophet

## Distibution Packages
* [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/libprophet-perl)
* [Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/libprophet-perl).
If you're running one of these operating systems, you can install the latest
prophet release like this:

>apt-get install libprophet-perl

# Git

The following command will get you a copy of the source tree you can install:

>git clone git://gitorious.org/prophet/prophet.git

The development branches require [Dist::Zilla](https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla)
to build.

Starting from v0.751, the tagged releases are already prepared by Dist::Zilla
and can be built with:

>cd prophet

>perl Build.PL

>./Build test

>./Build install

In the hopefully unlikely event that Prophet doesn't pass its tests,
please [tell the developers](/contact/) about it so we can improve things.
