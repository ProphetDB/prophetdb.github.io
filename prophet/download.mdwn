Released versions of Prophet are available on CPAN. Prophet is currently
undergoing rapid development however, so we recommend installing
directly from Git if you can.

The following command will get you a copy of the source tree you can install:

>git clone git://gitorious.org/prophet/prophet.git

Once you've downloaded Prophet, you can install it:

>cd prophet

>PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl Makefile.PL

>make test

>make install

In the hopefully unlikely event that Prophet doesn't pass its tests,
please [tell the developers](/contact/) about it so we can improve things.
